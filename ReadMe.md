This repository contains the code to the features incorporated in ML/AI on the use case "ATM Surveillance in Banks"

The functions perfomed by our ML/AI model are:

1. Face Recognition - Using FaceNet and haar cascades
2. Weapon and Skimming Device Detection - using Fast-RCNN
3. Helmet and Sunglass Detection - using CNN and haar cascades

An extension to this will be anomalous activity tracking using LSTM and CNN.
